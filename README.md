# TechProject5
 Portfolio with SQLAlchemy

The purpose of this project is to showcase
skills in Sqlalchemy as well as in Flask in  
a functional real-life application.

How to run the file:
Clone the repository and run app.py

This project was an excellent introduction
to Flask, html, and css. It has also helped
me to gain a greater understanding of the 
use of github.
